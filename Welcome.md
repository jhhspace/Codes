# Game codes

- Welcome to jhh's LUA code zone, here you will find codes that are coded in LUA for you to use (optional) in your ROBLOX game!
- Modifications to the codes are allowed so feel free to use it, you can credit me for making that code if you want :)

- Oh yes before you see the codes, you can support me by either [donating](http://mcdono.jhhspace.xyz/) or [voting](https://minecraftservers.org/vote/634551) for my minecraft server and to support my personal life too!

- If you find any errors, feel free to make a issue report [over here](https://github.com/jhhspace/Art-Gallery/issues)
- If you have any questions related or unrelated to the codes, for example you need help with certain coding errors, feel free to start a discussion [over here](https://github.com/jhhspace/Art-Gallery/discussions/categories/questions-issues)
